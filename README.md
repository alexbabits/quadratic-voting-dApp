## Overview
Quadratic Voting dApp using MongoDB, Next.js 13, Node.js & Web3 concepts. Users must login with a MetaMask account to submit a ballot containing their votes to the database. A dummy token `VTKN` was deployed on Sepolia Testnet to act as vote credits in the quadratic voting system.

## Build Process/Requirements
- Must be familiar with deploying smart contracts (I used hardhat with toolbox), Next.js 13, and MongoDB+Mongoose 7.
- Run `npm install`, `npx hardhat init`, and `npx create-next-app appname` to produce all the missing directories from .gitignore.
- Runs locally via `localhost:3000` using `npm run dev`. Must deploy `VoteToken.sol` on Sepolia so you have `VTKN` to actually test the dApp. You can distribute the token to multiple MetaMask addresses if you want to simulate voting. Also be sure to change the address to your deployed token inside `page.js`, and verify the ABI is correct. REMEMBER to be on the SEPOLIA network!


## What is a Quadratic Ranking System?
The core concept of a `Quadratic Ranking System` is that an `nth` (incremental) return costs `n` units of `time/energy/cost`. In a Quadratic voting system, the `nth` vote should cost `n` vote credits. For example, the 3rd vote will cost 3 credits, but the total cost for tallying up 3 votes also includes the cost for each previous vote needed to get to the 3rd vote. 

- 1 vote costs 1 vote credit total.
- 2 votes costs 3 vote credits total. (2 credit cost for 2nd vote, 1 credit cost for 1st vote).
- 3 votes costs 6 vote credits total. (3 credit cost for 3rd vote, 2 credit cost for 2nd vote, 1 credit cost for 1st vote).

This sequence (1, 3, 6, 10, 15...) is called the `triangular number sequence`. The `nth` number in the sequence corresponds to the `total cost` within our quadratic voting system. You can calculate the `nth` triangle number in the sequence with `n*(n+1)/2`, simplifying to a quadratic expression: `(n^2+n)/2`. If `n` is the number of votes someone wants to cast for a candidate, then the total cost in vote credits will be `(n^2+n)/2`. 

Vitalik's blog on Quadratic Payments approximates the cost of the `nth` vote to be `n^2/2` which is mostly correct. The cost of the last vote `n` also needs to be added which is why we arrive at `(n^2+n/2)`.

Note 1: Because quadratic voting mechanism makes the vote credit price non-linear to cast different amounts of votes, if two people have the same number of vote credits this does not guarentee the same number of total votes cast, since they can vary the amount of votes for each subject. One could choose to spread out votes more evenly, yielding more total votes, or choose to stack votes heavily on one candidate, which will consume more vote credits more quickly.

Note 2: Most articles and references believe the total cost should be exactly `n^2`. However, this yields the `nth` vote costing `2n-1` credits. To me it makes more sense to have the `nth` vote cost `n` credits. Both incremental cost increases are linear, and at the end of the day it is a fairly arbitrary argument reasoning about the "shoulds" for the steepness of the slope of two different lines. One noticable detail is that if there are 0 votes, the latter method costs -1 vote credit, which causes a fairly significant issue since mutli-candidate ballots will often get 0 votes on some candidates, with the technical cost of that supposing to be -1.

(Total Cost) ==> (Incremental cost for casting the last/most recent vote)
(1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28) ==> (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) ==> `nth vote costs n credits` ==> `total cost is (n^2+n)/2`
(1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49) ==> (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13) ==> `nth vote costs 2n-1 credits` ==> `total cost is n^2`


Food For Thought: 
- Which Quadratic Voting Model makes more sense? Why or why not?
- Is a Quadratic Voting System better at extracting more useful or detailed information from voters? 
- Is quadratic voting better than a rank choice voting system? Why or why not?
- What are the unseen side effects or unexpected results by allowing the voters to fine-tune their level of support for each topic?
- Humans have lots of traits that effect their voting styles/habits, such as biases towards certain numbers, laziness, convention, and so on. 
- What is the purpose of voting? What is "fair"? Does voting need to be this fine-tuned?
- What entities would want/improve from quadratic voting? Which entities would hate the idea?


## Core File Explanations (Mostly for Me)
- `database.js` 
    - Contains `dbConnect` function using mongoose to track and handle connection state of database. The database is named `voterdatabase`.
- `route.ts` 
    - DB Schema is two objects, the voter's `account` address, and a `voteArray` containing all the votes from a users ballot. The DB Model is `VotingData` named after the `votingData` collection.
    - `GET` function fetches all documents from the `votingData` collection.
    - `POST` function writes a users ballot, which is the `votingData`, which contains `voteArray` and `account` to the database.
- `page.js`
    - There are no components, I like the simplicity of this single file. The code is annotated well and contains four sections: `State Variables & Hooks`, `Web2 Functions`, `Web3 Functions`, and the jsx `return`.


## Next.js 12 vs 13 Changes (Mostly for Me)
- `pages` directory is now `app`. API routes are now API route handlers. The routes must be in `app`, recommended inside `app/api`.
- Name routes with the folder they are housed in: `app/api/myroutename`. The route within `myroutename` should always be called `route.ts`.
- `route.ts` names functions based directly on the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
- To make a GET request from `page.js`, we would name a function `GET` inside `route.ts`.
- The new App Router supports shared layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, etc.
- The components inside `app` default to React Server Components, but can also use/declare them as Client Components. 


## Notes (Mostly for Me)
- Run `npm init -y` to install basic package.json.
- Run `npx create-next-app appname` to create most of the starter folders for a Next.js project (`app` folder, `.next` folder)
- Run `npm run dev` which starts a local development server at `http://localhost:3000`. 
- Run `npx hardhat init` with baseline javascript project.
- Run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia` to deploy `VoteToken.sol`. `VTKN`: `0xcb76a79aE432a579c80be9674ce1Ab4a5A5E6f0D`.
- Run `npm install ws bufferutil utf-8-validate --save-optional` to fix warnings in terminal for Next.js 13 with ethers.
- Run `npm install toastify-js` for frontend popup notifications.
- Run `npm install mongodb` and `npm install mongoose` to install MongoDB and Mongoose. MongoDB sets up local server on my machine that can accept connections and store data. Mongoose makes CRUD easier with Object Data Modeling (ODM) so I can interact with MongoDB using JSON instead of raw queries. MongoDB housed locally at `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\7.0\`. MongoDB Compass is the GUI. Database name is `voterdatabase`, connection string `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/voterdatabase`.
- My API route handlers and database connection logic is housed inside `app/api`. The route name is the folder name. Inside `voterouting` contains `route.ts` and `database.js`. The route file must be named `route.ts`. Route handlers substitute the traditional Express backend server.


## Improvements
- Implement a DAO contract which would handle the on chain execution of the actual result of the voting.
- Break up page.js into components (not really an improvement imo for this project).
- Faster load time, bundle state updates
