Quadratic voting:

ITS NOT N^2, ITS N^2/2. VITALIK HAS IT RIGHT. SHOW THE GRAPHS!
Each votes `price` changes. You pay one for 1st vote, two credits for 2nd vote, (Totaling 3, and so on.)
If everyone is given 100 credits, does not mean that each will get the same number of votes.
Because each vote costs a different amount, some may choose to spread out votes more, giving more total votes.
Or some may choose to stack votes heavily on one candidate, which will consume more vote credits more quickly.
